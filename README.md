# employee_project.sql

The employee_project.sql file creates a table of employee and projects filled with attributes in order fulfill the requirements for an assignment in my Database class at Columbus State. 

This file will begin as an empty file. As I work it, I will be updating its content until development of the code is complete. I have chosen this method in order to practice updating a file from Github using Gitbash.

# Oracle

The SQL uses Oracle's version of SQL. In order to run this file, access to an Oracle SQL *Plus database will be required in order to run this file. 

When this file is run, it'll create tables with various attributes, organize them, and display three formated reports displaying information on employees, projects, and the employee assigned to which project.# employee-projects
